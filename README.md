## ðŸ“Š HR Retention Analytics Project

During my internship, I worked on an exciting HR Analytics project with Aiverient, a leading analytics firm known for its deep expertise across various industries. This project involved applying data analytics to improve talent identification, attraction, acquisition, development, and retention. Through this project, I aimed to demonstrate the power of HR Analytics in driving business outcomes and fostering a data-driven decision-making culture within organizations.

### Key Contributions:
- Leveraged **Excel** for data cleaning, manipulation, and basic analysis.
- Utilized **Tableau** to create interactive dashboards and visualize HR metrics.
- Employed **PowerBI** for advanced data analysis and business intelligence reporting.
- Presented findings using **PowerPoint** to ensure clear communication.

All the reports and presentations I created during this project are available in my GitHub repository.

In addition to HR Analytics, I completed another project: the "Olist Store Analysis." As part of my internship with Aiverient, I led this project within the e-commerce domain. Here are the details:
